        p The 
          a(href='w3c') Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)
          |  began work on the new standard in 2004. At that time, HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000, and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was focusing future developments on XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group&apos;s charter to expire and decided not to renew it.                 
        p The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) workshop in June 2004, focusing on developing technologies that are backward-compatible with existing browsers, including an initial draft specification of Web Forms 2.0. The workshop concluded with a vote&mdash;8 for, 14 against&mdash;for continuing work on HTML. Immediately after the workshop, WHATWG was formed to start work based upon that position paper, and a second draft, Web Applications 1.0, was also announced. The two specifications were later merged to form HTML5. The HTML5 specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group of the W3C in 2007.                 
        p.section__highlighted-text WHATWG&apos;s Ian Hickson (Google) and David Hyatt (Apple) produced W3C&apos;s first public working draft of the specification on 22 January 2008.

          p While some 
            a(href='features') features
            |  of HTML5 are often compared to Adobe Flash, the two technologies are very different. Both include features for playing audio and video within web pages, and for using Scalable Vector Graphics. However, HTML5 on its own cannot be used for animation or interactivity &ndash; it must be supplemented with CSS3 or JavaScript. There are many Flash capabilities that have no direct counterpart in HTML5 (see 
            a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_HTML5_and_Flash', target='blank') Comparison of HTML5 and Flash
            | ). HTML5&apos;s interactive capabilities became a topic of mainstream media attention around April 2010 after Apple Inc.&apos;s then-CEO Steve Jobs issued a public letter titled &quot;Thoughts on Flash&quot; in which he concluded that &quot;Flash is no longer necessary to watch video or consume any kind of web content&quot; and that &quot;new open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win&quot;. This sparked a debate in web development circles suggesting that, while HTML5 provides enhanced functionality, developers must consider the varying browser support of the different parts of the standard as well as other functionality differences between HTML5 and Flash. In early November 2011, Adobe announced that it would discontinue development of Flash for mobile devices and reorient its efforts in developing tools using HTML5. On 25 July 2017, Adobe announced that both the distribution and support of Flash would cease by the end of 2020. Flash was officially discontinued on 31 December 2020 and all Flash content was blocked from running in Flash Player as of 12 January 2021.

        section#Last-Call
          p On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to &quot;Last Call&quot;, an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation. In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its &quot;HTML5&quot; specification HTML Living Standard. The W3C nevertheless continued its project to release HTML5.                     
          p In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered as a &quot;snapshot&quot; by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization continues its work with HTML5 as a &quot;living standard&quot;. The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.                     
          p In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation. The criterion for advancement to W3C Recommendation is &quot;two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations&quot;.                     
          p On 16 September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation. On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a W3C Recommendation, bringing the specification process to completion. On 1 November 2016, HTML 5.1 was released as a W3C Recommendation. On 14 December 2017, HTML 5.2 was released as a W3C Recommendation (see
