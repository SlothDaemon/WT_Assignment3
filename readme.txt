Pim Versteeg has not done anything for this assessment. Our assignment mentor Joep Kneefel has been informed about this per email.

The website is live at
http://webtech.science.uu.nl/group10

As per the express-generator template, the script to start the website is located in bin/www, which in turn calls upon the main script app.js in the root folder. This imports a variety of libraries, of which we have added Joi for user input sanitation and validation and sdlite3 as a login-, profile and question database and express sessions for logins. 
Our webpages are no longer static HTML pages, they are now Jade views, which you can find under the views folder. All non-layout.jade views extend layout.jade, which holds the render for the header with flash messages, navbar with login form, and the foother. The other views hold the respective content of the pages. views/users/profile.jade is filled in by looking up the data of the profiles database of the requested user's profile (so http://webtech.science.uu.nl/group10/users/admin would lookup user "admin"'s profile data. As a consequence, unregistered users have no saved data, as per specification.
These views are navigated to by the routes under the routes/ folder, index.js for navigating to a non-user webpage and re-routing AJAX requests to assessment.js, login.js catches all POST request that happen on the website, users.js generates the user profiles of the registered users, and assessment.js deals with all AJAX requests.
Our static folder is calld public/, which holds the client-side JS, CSS and images. You can find style.css in the css/ folder, which does the styling of our webpages. The js/ folder has the jquery library, which we use for ajax requests, and the script.js file. This file holds all client-side functions and requests data from the server with AJAX to enable the assessment page.
The sql/ folder holds our sql database. The selfsame folder holds the sql database definition for your perusal. Additionally, it's copy-pasted below, along with the insert statements used to fill the database with the topics, quizes and questions. 
The database has seven tables. The Topic table holds the data of each topic. The Quiz table has data of each quiz, including which topic it is in. The Question table has question data, including the quiz it belongs to. The MultipleChoice table contains question ids of all multiple choice typed questions, together with the four possible options. The LOGINS table stores a user's username and permissionlevel, and a salt and hash for the password. The PROFILES table stores a user's username, bio, the amount of correctly answered questions and the question the user last visited. The Attempt table stores all attempts on questions by each user, and whether the answer was correct or not.
