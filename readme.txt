The website is live at
http://webtech.science.uu.nl/group10

As per the express-generator template, the script to start the website is located in bin/www, which in turn calls upon the main script app.js in the root folder. This imports a variety of libraries, of which we have added Joi for user input sanitation and validation and sdlite3 as a login- profile and question database and express sessions for logins. 
Our webpages are no longer static HTML pages, they are now Jade views, which you can find under the views folder. All non-layout.jade views extend layout.jade, which holds the render for the header with flash messages, navbar with login form, and the foother. The other views hold the respective content of the pages. views/users/profile.jade is filled in by looking up the data of the profiles database of the requested user's profile (so http://webtech.science.uu.nl/group10/users/admin would lookup user "admin"'s profile data. As a consequence, unregistered users have no saved data, as per specification.
These views are navigated to by the routes under the routes/ folder, index.js for navigating to a non-user webpage, login.js catches all POST request that happen on the website, and users.js generates the user profiles of the registered users.
our static folder is calld public/, which holds the client-side JS, CSS and images.
the sql/ folder holds our sql database. the selfsame folder holds the sql database definition for your perusal. additionally, it's copy-pasted below.
